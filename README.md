# instructor-smart-contract
Followed a tutorial to learn more about how Smart Contracts and the Ethereum Blockchain work. I tailored some of the function names to make it more personal. I used bootstrap on the UI instead of vanilla HTML. 

Things learned: 
  1. Basic understanding on how smart contracts are developed and how to deploy it on the Ethereum Blockchain.
  2. How to connect UI to blockchain back-end using Web3.js.
  3. Solidity keywords (strings or bytes16, int, uint).
  4. How to use modifiers and mapping.
  5. Difference between memory and storage.
  6. What structs are.
  7. How to have a contract inherit structs from another contract when deploying a new contract.

Ethereum Smart Contract were made using Solidity on the REMIX IDE. Used Web3.js to communicate between the UI and the Ethereum blockchain. Used MetaMask to test/deploy contracts/transactions.
